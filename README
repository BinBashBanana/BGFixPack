What Has Gone Before
The game Baldur's Gate and it's expansion pack Tales of the Sword Coast while an enjoyable experience is known to still contain errors throughout the game.  While some situations pass by unoticeably due to specifc roleplay, other situations are blatantly present. There have been several attempts over the years to provide corrections to many of these situations. First there was Kevin Dorner and his fix pack called "Baldurdash". Then there was Dudley and his broad collection of fixes and arguably extreme modifications towards a more D&D Pen & Paper style experience which collectively have become known as "Dudleyville". Following the advent of WeiDU, Idobek at Gibberlings3.net began to create a weidu based fix pack which was to combine the many elements of Baldurdash and Dudleyville into a singular easy to install and uninstall package. This project was never finished and was in fact abandoned with many of it's questionable elements transferring to a new project called Unfinished Buisness. It is here that an upstart modder with barely any knowledge of the previous fix packs took on the daunting task of creating a singular weidu based fix pack.
