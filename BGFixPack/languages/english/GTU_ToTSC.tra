@22181 = ~Remove Curse
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Line of sight of caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect

The Polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~
@22314 = ~Aye, here is your ragged cloak. Drape it where'er ye wish.~
@22317 = ~I thank. You will be thought of well, though I still unlike your manner. You have my gratitude despite. Farewell.~

@22322 = ~Polymorph Self
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds / level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.
When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime.~

Through the chronicles of my deeds, pride shall be honored
Through the passing of knowledge my sword shall display its glory

@22382 = ~You need not honor with formality, "m'lady." I am Durlyle, and I am pleasured to meet ye.~
@22387 = ~Who you? You do not belong... you are none like I have seen. To Kaishas you must go. She leads and you must ask her will to stay. Others may attack if you do not speak to she. Do... do come back when you have. I wish to speak.~
@22390 = ~A prominent and odd place for a cloak. Of what significance is it?~
@22392 = ~You are quite gruff, quick to the point and no time to falter? I find it refreshing. Others in the village are sickly sweet, and sometimes their company is a chore. You and your scent are so obviously different. Proper introduction then. I am Durlyle, and I am glad to be meeting you.~
@22394 = ~I say again, what of it? State your mind and leave me be.~

@22609 = ~Spirit Armor
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.
The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, however the dexterity bonus still applies as well as magic rings or other protection devices, and a shield. While in effect the AC (Armor Class) of the recipient will be 1, as if he was wearing plate mail. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, he will also receive a +3 bonus to save vs. magical attacks.
There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2D4 points of damage upon the target.~
@22611 = ~Chaos
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round / level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60' cube
Saving Throw: Special

The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th level spell confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking, either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, he does not receive a saving throw versus the effects. However if the victim is 5th level or higher, he receives a save vs. spells at -4. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful dispel magic is cast.~
@22613 = ~Feeblemind
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect

Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate to that of a simple beast of burden, remaining in this state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon the subject. The victim must make a save vs. spells at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22615 = ~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Line of sight of caster
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect

The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell mental domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals, except of course a dispel magic. The target gets a saving throw vs. spells at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22617 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 60' cube
Saving Throw: Negates Effect

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for nine or more rounds, unless a save vs. spells is made with a -2 penalty.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected.  Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@22619 = ~Mental Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Sphere: Thought
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 3 rounds / level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect

When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spells at -2 in order to avoid the priest entering his mind. The effects of this spell are similar to the wizard spell domination, with a few minor differences. First this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration. To control the subject the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. Also, this requires a moderate amount of concentration from the priest, so he may enter combat and attack, however he cannot cast another spell.~
@22621 = ~Protection From Lightning
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds / level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to Electrical attack, such as lightning bolts, shocking grasp, etc. The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@22695 = ~Long Sword +1: "The Vampiric's Revenge"

It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade, instead of performing as one might think a vampiric blade would, was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that could eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent it's removal, and the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. This may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking, and one might better spend ones time having a lovely beverage, rather than gallivanting about the wilderness with a pack full of rubbish chasing phantoms.

Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. Although, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection then leather armor, one must get by the offensive odour and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities.

@22786 = ~Club +1, +3 vs. Unnatural Creatures: "The Root of the Problem"

This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims of this age were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Sphere: Law
Range: 5 yards
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enchanted coordination of their attacks and defenses. This allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster but affects all those within a 10-foot radius. The affected can move outside of this after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of the harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class. This lasts for 6 rounds or until successfully dispelled.~
@22832 = ~Protection From Evil 10' radius
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn / level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by "protection from evil." It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects: first, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll; second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus; and third, the protected creature is immune to the effects of charm spells.~
@22834 = ~Champion's Strength
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Law
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 3 rounds / level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spells is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of his god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to his THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell, and all the bonuses to hit and damage that this strength confers. Note also that if the target's strength is above 18/00, it will actually be reduced to this value.
The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and his god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~
@22835 = ~Such overconfidence will prove its downfall.~
@22840 = ~It would appear that time has not been kind to the pages of this tome, but snippets of information are still readable.

... weather is clear and we shall make Anchorome in goodly time, of that I have no doubt...

... have calmed the crew, though nervouse they will remain. I blame them not, for it was not a pleasante encounter in the least. Bloody Elves would do well to remember that the sea belongs to no one, save the gods that guard her. I shall avoide the northerly passage just the same, if only to prevent another overzealouse boarding party. Such paranoia from the "fair folk..."

... arrived in Anchorome, and I am remembered by a goodly number of people, not all fondly...

... but "his grace" has deemed me worthy to proceed through his lands. I am quite sure the two hundred-strong complement of the Wandering Eye aided in the decision. Still, we were received in goode humore, and I will not request tribute...

... adventure it has been! Such wealth as this... only in the deepest ruins of home. Here it is almost for the taking, with only a measure of "diplomatic" discussions as the cost...

... attacked, and barely made it to the ship in time. Dradeel did warn of such, but who is to trust a worde from his mouth? I do sweare, his senses seem addled at the best of times...

... the crew, but a larger share for the remaining will keep them well and truly happy. I shall conscript replacements from the local populace this night, and we shall set our sails at dawn...

... delays, but with one hundred and fifty new hands, one must expect the going to be slow at the start. They seem quite calm and orderly, not at all as I expected...

... should have searched! We cast him out, but his words... eady inflamed the crew. I know not what was worse, the shaman's constant... or the reaction of the crew when he was committed to the sea. Their eyes are... and resigned. I dislike a crew with no fire in their bellies, but I do suppose it is better than a fire in the hold...

... weather unseasonable, and the moode does worsen. As well, beetles have beset the foode stores, and we shall surely be hungry long before reaching the coast of home...

... set aground to forage. It is a small isle, but will yield what we need. Perhaps I shall... on my own while the crew... time on land will do them goode...

... original men seem quite shallow in the face, quite different from the pallor of the new recruits, but all are most definitely ill...

@22912 = ~H-hello there. How about I ask you nicely to leave, and then you... um... leave?~
@22914 = ~Hurgan hadn't told us everything when he sent us to retrieve the dagger. It appears that the dagger contains the soul of an evil demon that killed Hurgan's grandfather. The people that ambushed us are members of the cult that worships the beast. Hurgan believes that they wish to bring the demon back to life within their house in Ulgoth's Beard and would like us to stop them.~
@22917 = ~A salty sea-dog by the name of Calahan tells us that Mendas, the scholar from Waterdeep, keeps to himself and is away several days a month on business.~

@22923 = ~We have met an elven mage who seems to be a bit insane. He claims to be Balduran's friend and navigator on the hero's final voyage. He also claims that this island is infested by lycanthropes.~
@22926 = ~They are children who don't know better. Now you face a true opponent!~
@22930 = ~A gnomish woman named Dushai claims to have knowledge of Balduran's final voyage. She will share it with us for a "research fee."~
@22932 = ~You talk pretty confidently for someone who has only tested their strength against children and commoners.~
@22933 = ~You seek to reason with death? Your words mean nothing and fall as leaves to the winter. I will listen to your screams, but your words do not interest. You are tools to be cast aside, now that your task is done. You will die as these whelps behind.~
@22934 = ~Evalt, a fisherman descendant of Balduran's crew, tells us that his brother was kidnapped by a "blue witch." He asks that we look for his brother when we are on the north half of the island.~
@22939 = ~They were weak! I am stronger, and will be a worthy opponent!~
@22941 = ~Fenrus Boulon has told us that Durlag's Tower was built by a famous dwarven hero name Durlag Trollkiller. The wealth that he amassed was coveted by a group of mindflayers, who used doppelgangers to kill and replace Durlag's family. The hero killed the beasts but was driven mad in the process. He entrapped the Tower and disappeared within its depths.~
@22947 = ~Mendas has sent us to the Counting House of the Merchant League in Baldur's Gate. We are to "obtain" the sea charts for him. The Counting House should be located in the northeastern quadrant of the city.~
@22950 = ~They were not worthy of my blade. With the aid of a trinket they destroyed themselves. They should thank, that I allowed them to die by their own hand instead of killing them like insects. One yet lives. Perhaps I should kill with the old rituals, and bring forth a proper minion. He will outlive his worthless companions in undeath. Their age, your age, is the age of all mortals, and it is irrelevant. You do not know true age, and you could not until you have outlived a dragon or an elf, or a legend. Death can be eternal sleep, or the one eternal life. You will know the sleep, and I will still be the life. You have fulfilled your purpose. I took the tower as a base that is fortified and secure. You have been the foolish maid service that cleaned it of traps for me. The madness of Durlag has built me a fine home, and you have swept the floors.~
@22962 = ~You foolish mortal! You have exposed us all to the mirror's tainted effects! It is cracked and malfunctioning! I will see you long-suffering before your death!~
@22963 = ~You may ask what you wish, but you will get no answers. Die you will, but I know well that the dead do not hold their tongues as well as they should. Understanding is beyond you; dying, your only option. I will take your heads with my own blade; you have served well and have earned the honor.~
@22964 = ~Your flesh shows its weakness and stupidity. You understand only mortal gains: wealth, luxury, lust. You have no more a chance to understand me than defeat me. I will kill you with my own hands, and perhaps you will realize the error of your challenges.~
@22965 = ~A mere toy. There is value in the suffering it causes, but you will not have its gift. It is cracked and malfunctioning, though it still does a measure of what is intended. I will repair it and await more adventurers who wish to test their resolve. You will have the honor of dying by my very hand, as reward for your unintentional service. You have descended deep and found naught but doom. Such a waste.~
@22966 = ~This ornate weapon has "Vampiric Sword" written in bold common text along the entire length of its blade.

@22968 = ~You have come. I suppose it was inevitable. You weathered Durlag's Tower, so breaching our meager defenses would be a minor feat. It is of little concern. In a matter of seconds creatures such as you will be powerless before us.~
@22975 = ~Grand threats for someone so close to death. There will be much blood shed in the next age; much more than you and your meager blades and spells will manage. Aec'Letec has spoken in my fever-dreams, and we are assured of power beyond comprehension! Your souls will feed his rise! The dagger is broken! Let the new lord arise!~
@22977 = ~Adventurers, you must leave this place. These are the spawn of the cursed ones that murdered us so many years ago. They have broken into two factions. The dark ones inhabit the ship and the lighter ones have built this town. These ones have built a ship. If you hurry you may yet escape.~
@22981 = ~The ship lies beyond the mountains to the east. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now, the way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. The chieftain's woman is at the boat right now. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.~
@22982 = ~This headwoman, Kaishas, had the ship built months ago. She has been waiting for her husband, Selaad to return with maps that they might use to return to the mainland. At present, she only knows that it is east. She has gone to the ship that they have built. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now, the way is frought with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.~
@22983 = ~Be as rude as you wish. For your help earlier, I will give you this advice. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship where the chieftan's woman is. I warn you now, the way is frought with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry then! I thank you for my freedom. Perhaps we shall meet again someday.~
@22985 = ~Heroic friends, I am sorry for what is happening. I fear that we are led by one with evil heart. In the large hut northwest of here, there is a hidden door that leads to our homes below the ground. Within you shall find an exit to the ship.~
@22987 = ~I am still surprised that you saved my child at all. You do not seem the least bit heroic. It is better that you take the ship and leave us here. We would never wish to live with such as you.~
@22994 = ~You are correct that we shall need powerful allies. How fortunate for us that we are summoning one and will not need you! You would dare suggest that you should be granted immunity from the coming storm, just because you feign loyalty at this moment? We have worshiped for years upon years, and planned for this day to the exclusion of all else. You are but spit in the ocean, and unworthy! Your time is past! Aec'Letec will deliver you from life! The dagger is broken! Witness the new lord arise! ~

@23011 = ~Durlag... Durlag, my friend! You have returned, after age upon age. It is I, Daital, your friend of old. I have waited... waited long for your coming that I might help. My friend...~
@23012 = ~Of course... er... Daital. I have... missed your company.~
@23013 = ~Foul specter, you are blind in your undeath. I am not Durlag, and you are not my friend!~
@23018 = ~You are uncharacteristically civil this day, Durlag... and I think you are... taller... than I recall. Time changes us all, I guess, though it has not erased my debt. I will serve here until you wish otherwise, to repay... repay... I barely remember what I owe, but it matters not.~
@23020 = ~Then you are invaders in his home! I will avenge! Durlag, If you hear me, I am sorry I was not here to aid! My debt goes unpaid! I will expel these creatures and any other... you will rest easy, I swear it!~
@23023 = ~I see you are as crotchety as ever to non-dwarven kin, though you yourself seem... taller than I recall. Perhaps it is me. I recall so little with clarity these days... years. I am here to serve as best I can... to repay the debt I owe... I barely recall how I incurred it, but repay I will.~
@23026 = ~What is it you think you owe... me? What do you hope to repay?~
@23027 = ~You need not have waited so long. Perhaps if you paid through some other means you might rest easy. Have you anything else I might take as payment? Anything... valuable?~
@23030 = ~It is not gold I owe, but honor! Your clan was a refuge to me, to my family until... you fought them off when I could not strike my... my children changed to doubles... you... you have no need of wealth; we waded through dragon hoards and left with empty pockets, you and I. You have changed much since you... since I... death... death took us both! You are not Durlag! He valued family over all! You are invaders! I will repel you and he will rest easy! I will repay!~
@23031 = ~You speak of the old like it does not matter... you know better. When the hordes came wearing the faces of friends, you fought when I would not... could not strike... I was an outsider among your clan, and you defended when all did turn against... I was released from life... but never from debt. Do not turn me away... a friend would not turn me... you are different... you are not the same... you are not Durlag! I will defend!~
@23032 = ~The debt? You know the debt... when the evil came and took the faces of your clan, when your friends and mine became evil unmatched... you protected and fought though it pained. I could not harm... I could not strike at the clan I called family... you fought them all... though it hurt you more... I was the lucky one, and was released from the nightmare of life... the easy way. I will repay... you should know this... you should know! You have changed! You are not Durlag!~
@23061 = ~Ye doubt I am Durlag? Well, give the fool a prize; turns out I'm not the dwarf that's been dead o'er a bunch of centuries. Good for you, but my question still stands: who are you? I don't care a whit what you are doing in the tower; I just want to know what you are doing sneaking up on my backside. I don't like people sneakin' near me. Makes me nervous.~
@23070 = ~Relax your suspicions; I am not your enemy. This place is quite full enough of traps without us fighting each other. What is your name?~
@23074 = ~Welcome to the game of Chess. You have just defeated the last of the four elemental guardians and so this is your next stop. I hope your stay within my tower has been pleasant, but if you have been bored, I have included this game to spice things up somewhat.  There are some rules that must be adhered to while playing the game. The first one is to stay on your respective squares. Your king cannot move from his square, your queen may move into any square. The black bishop must stay to the black squares, while the white bishop keeps to the white square. The knights can travel anywhere, but always take the risk of some pain. If you move into a square that is restricted to you, lightning will be sent to punish your transgression.~
@23075 = ~Remember, when one king falls the game is done.~
@23076 = ~You should be nervous. If anything were to... happen... to you in here, no one could say it wasn't just another adventurer dying in some dungeon.~
@23077 = ~No, I suppose not. You are doing the same task that I am, though I don't like ye working so close to me. Makes me nervous. Move yourselves to another level, and leave this area to me.~
@23090 = ~Well, hello there. Come to see little ol' Kirinhale, have ye? It's been sooo long since I've had any company at all, and now... well... just look at you. So virile, so... manly. Care to stay here by my side? It will be ever so lonely without you.~
@23091 = ~My dear lady, why have you languished in this place for so long?~
@23095 = ~It's a terrible story, really. Wandered in some time ago, and it's just not safe to leave on my own. So many dangers, and no protective hand to guide me. I'm almost without hope... Would you... would you stay here with me? It's so lonely here.~
@23098 = ~I suppose I could... entertain you for a little while. I never could turn down a pretty face.~
@23100 = ~You forsake me? Have I lost so much appeal in my time here? This place is destroying my charms and I can do nothing but sit and wait for someone else to take my place. Well, no more! Durlag and his curse be damned, you'll stay here instead of me and you'll damn well like it! He took my wings, but I've still a few tricks at my disposal!~
@23101 = ~Excellent, though "a little while" is not quite what I had in mind. You see, there's a matter of a teeny weeny curse that that mean ol' Durlag put on me. A tiny thing really, but I need your help. You want to help me, don't you? Hmm? I need someone brave and strong to do something for me. I need you to stay here instead of me. Will you do this? Will you do this for me?~
@23104 = ~Durlag put this curse on you? But he has not been seen in over three hundred years.~
@23105 = ~Your offer is not quite what I require. I really must insist. I really must demand! I'll not sit here another three hundred years because of you! You will stay here! That bastard Durlag took my wings and imprisoned me, but I can still deal with your puny mortal mind! I'll not end up like Aec! I'll not!~
@23106 = ~Oh, a short amount of time... relatively speaking. A mere drop in the bucket compared to the lives of elves or dragons... or gods. I figure I have about another four hundred years to go before the dweomers weaken enough to simply walk out. You're lucky. You'll die of starvation long before then.~
@23115 = ~I shall repaint the walls with your blood! A little redecorating will make the next hundred years a little more bearable!~
@23116 = ~Another? You would do this? Oh, you are deliciously wicked. Perhaps there is a way. Take this lock of my hair, and find someone near this place. Tell him it is a lock of nymph's hair. If you can pass it to another mortal male and he accepts it, he will be accepting part of me. That will free me and imprison him here for the rest of his life. They must be within the tower for the enchantment to work. Such an act will undoubtedly reflect in your karma as the magics of this place are powerful indeed, but I will be oh sooo grateful. You'll like me when I'm grateful. Will you do this for me? Will you? So what if some fool starves to death here?~
@23124 = ~Do so! I grow impatient.~
@23125 = ~I am... I am free! I can feel the chains lifted! My powers return! I'll have my wings back before I reach the third plane of home! You have done as you said, and we had a fair and equitable agreement. What was it I promised? Unearthly delights and all that? It really is a pity that I had no intention of honoring our little bargain. I leave you your life, however, and I will refrain from dragging you down when I return home. My kind will see you again, though. Your type is destined to meet mine.~
@23131 = ~I have no time for helpless maidens that cannot fend for themselves.~
@23133 = ~Durlag and I had a... disagreement about the treatment of a friend of mine. My attempts at... reasonable arguments went unheeded, and I have been trapped here ever since. Some three hundred years or so, and that Damned Durlag is nowhere to be found.~
@23137 = ~Oh, come now. I'll share whatever I find with you.~
@23139 = ~If that is what you wish, so be it.~
@23140 = ~Ha! The day I would believe a dungeon-crawler would share his loot, is the coldest day the nine hells will have ever seen. Wander as you will, and if I ever see a coin from you I will be completely surprised.~
@23148 = ~Eh, another righteous smiter of evil. Go where you wish then, but leave me the goodies. You don't want to be spoiling your spotless halo with ill-gotten coins, eh? Yeah, right. Pious, you may be, but I'll be surprised if I ever see a coin from you.~
@23153 = ~Greetings, manling. I am Meiala, sirine warrior and enchanter. I have no peer among my people, and I will smite any enemy that we might come across.~
@23154 = ~I am Moorlock. All that you need to know about me is that my skill as a warrior is unparalleled. Show me what monsters I might vanquish.~
@23155 = ~Me Hack! Me crush enemies! Show Hack enemies to turn into mush!~
@23156 = ~I'm Tarnor. Let's not waste any time with introductions, just show me what needs killin' and I'll get to work on them with me axe.~
@23158 = ~I am Bullrush of the clan Blackmane. There is nothing that can escape the sting of my arrows. Show me your enemies so that I may kill them and drink their blood.~
@23164 = ~You again? What is it now? I've warned you once about bothering me. I've a good handle on some puzzles below and I don't need you disturbing my thinking.~
@23177 = ~Greetings adventurers. So many of you have come down to loot the ancient basements of Durlag, yet none ever return. Adventurers are not known for their wisdom, otherwise they'd have chosen a safer profession. Take the five people that stand behind me, forever frozen in stone. Each one of these foolish men and women came to find Durlag's treasure. Now they stand vigil over Durlag's bestiary. Most of the other creatures have long disintegrated to dust, but the great wyrm known as Mechezarin still hangs in its original repose of death. Breathtaking, isn't he?~
@23178 = ~No need for us to be friends, either. Get out of here, before I decide you are more trouble than you are worth.~
@23180 = ~Ah, get out of my sight! I don't need to answer to you. Maybe I should just kill you now and be done with you!~
@23187 = ~If you travel further into the room you will find the only living creatures that remain within the bestiary. These winged beasts have lived for centuries, augmented by ancient and powerful magics. None so far have been able to defeat them. However, if you wish to defeat the terrible beasts, there is help available to you. Each of the statues behind me houses the cursed body of some poor hero. By depressing the button at the base of each statue, you will release the ancient hero. The hero is enspelled to serve you for a short time, but after that time has run out he'll take his revenge on he who dared command him. There's nothing more for me to say. Goodbye now.~
@23189 = ~This place is a bountiful hunting ground. I'll split this with you just because we're in the same line of work. Here's 300 gold.~
@23190 = ~Actually, I've got a gift for you just because we're in the same line of work. I found this upstairs in a chest. I'm no expert, but it looks like nymph's hair to me.~
@23191 = ~I'm not here to disturb you. I came back to give you a peace offering. No need for us to fight. I may not be an expert, but I think this might be nymph's hair. It's yours, if you want it.~
@23193 = ~Three hundred...? What are you up to? You... you trying to butter me up? You got no reason to give me this. Well, alright then. You ain't so bad after all. Maybe I've been wrong about you... maybe. You're alright... but don't be hangin' around too long anyway, lest I change my mind.~
@23196 = ~Don't get all bent outta shape; I'm just trying to be neighborly!~
@23198 = ~That's the thanks I get? I've about had enough of you! If you are determined to fight, let's get it over with!~
@23200 = ~Wha... what? You're giving me... I guess I was wrong about you. I guess you're a pretty decent person after all. Here, friend, here's a little toy I found myself. Fair trade for an honest person. Riggilo will speak well of your name to anyone who asks.~
@23202 = ~Alright then. NO! That plain enough for you? I don't need your stinkin' nymph's hair, and I don't need you poking around. Get outta here! I trust you about as far as I could throw you!~
@23207 = ~This statue is a representation of the sirine warrior Meiala.~
@23212 = ~The mask intones: "Down four tunnels lie four foes. Kill all four and the game begins."~
@23214 = ~The mask intones: "Queening can change a match: much for the worse if you're the other player."~
@23215 = ~The mask intones: "Fire, ice, slime and wind. All must perish to continue. She who fires flame must be killed before her bow is drawn."~
@23218 = ~This lock of hair comes from the head of a succubus, a demonic creature that seduces men into accompanying her to the hells.

With axe and fire he cleansed the land of beasts he loved to fight, when axe alone would not suffice. I ask the second name of Durlag. ~

@23288 = ~It began with usssss... and the mastersss. The tentacled ones directed and we assssaulted quietly with cover of night. We took of the weaker firssst, hiding amidsst the childrrren. None sssaw the arrival, none noticed the insssurrgence, and none sssurvived the final rissse. When Durlag realizzzed the deception it was too late! His own family sssought his life, and he ssslaughtered their falssse facessss. It began with usss, from the wessst.~
@23289 = ~This is not my face. The invaders came and took my true face, burying it with my body and my comrades. I was among the last, but not the very last, and I saw the horror to come. My child rose against me, though it was no longer my child. It wore her face, but I knew her to be dead. The doppelgangers came from within, and we could not fight ourselves. Better to die than to kill ourselves. What would be left of a man that has had to kill his family... and himself? I was among the last, but not the very last.~
@23290 = ~We entrenched this place against all that would come. We built retribution in the trip wires and vengeance in the fireballs. We worked the hatred into every nook and cranny, just as he wished, but our actions were guided from elsewhere.

@23310 = ~We followed Durlag. We were his people, his family. Durlag Trollkiller, son of Bolher Thunderaxe the Clanless, formed this place with the spoils of a lifetime of adventure. It was majestic in those times, and we took what we needed from the fortune around us. We grew strong and proud, and Durlag felt he finally had a home. We were the future, his family, and if we were lost, then so was he. That was the fear that hid, that was beneath. We followed Durlag. We were his people.~
@23311 = ~My father roamed as I, and saw much of the world in his time. Well respected he was, but he had no home. At his end, he died in some far away land, with no dwarven kin by his side. I would not allow such to happen to me. I would not follow his steps that far. I would not be Durlag the Clanless. This was my fear. Trace the path of this fear, and show me you have learned.~
@23313 = ~It began with your clan, and your fear of losing them. The craftsmen fortified this place with it, and then it manifested in the invaders. Now it haunts you always.~

@23338 = ~I met a woman in the lower portion of Durlag's Tower. She was apparently part of another group of adventurers that were all wiped out. She says it was a demonknight that killed them; a hellishly powerful form of undead. She also said it employed a strange magic to defeat her friends: something involving a "Mirror of Opposition," or a related type of device. It created duplicates of the party and they were forced to kill themselves. Appropriate I suppose, what with the way Durlag's Tower originally fell. She suggested that I try to turn the mirror on the demonknight itself, though this would assuredly expose the rest of the room as well. The creature may be too powerful to assault directly, so I will give this much thought.~

@23348 = ~Werewolves! They are all werewolves! And I have been infected! They were aboard Balduran's ship when they turned, and the crew scuttled the ship rather than fight. They have lived here for hundreds of years, but now they must fall before me!~
@23349 = ~Werewolves! They descended from the original crew of Balduran's ship, but they are all werewolves. That's why their ship was scuttled in the first place! They infected me with lycanthropy as a "gift," so that I might "belong" with them. I'm sure we could have resolved things, but other members of their village would not have it. I must fight my way through them now, and escape as best I can.~
@23352 = ~I offered her a chance to live, but Kaishas insisted on fighting to the last. She mentioned that her people might have a second chance if Selaad returned, so I shall keep watch for him as well.~
@23360 = ~Come you have to this cursed place? Fools you are, and doomed as well. Welcome to the damned! You will stay here, yes you will. I guard the withered corpse of that fool Durlag, because there is little else to do.~
@23364 = ~And your goodness will not help me, or any of my kind. All in this place are beyond the help of mortals. I am Grael, and like you I was. I fought the evil that dared to walk the earth, and this was the reward for me. I stared down the gaze of none other than a Tanar'ri, and my flesh did fail. Beware you well the death gaze of the beasts of hell.~
@23366 = ~My heart positively bleeds for you. Thank you for your concern, but I have no need of advice from failures.~
@23368 = ~Your warning is unnecessary. I know well how to handle creatures of evil, just as I know how I must handle you. Your misery must be stopped. Your evil lives cause you pain, and must be ended.~
@23369 = ~My last words? Last words I spoke when my body died. I like to think there was much lamenting when Grael fell, but it was but a sidebar. Durlag entrapped the beast, and his was the victory blow that is legend. A great evil, but not even the fight that is remembered in this tower. My reward is undeath. My reward is the curse of this place and the madness that claimed it.~
@23371 = ~I encountered a ghoul of great power, named Grael. He offered a warning about something called a Tanar'ri, and the horrible "death-gaze" it wields. A "gaze that is not a gaze." Sounds more insidious than even the gaze of the basilisk. I wonder if the traditional precautions will even function against it? I shall keep this in mind, though I doubt I will meet such a creature. It has been ages since Grael's battle took place.~
@23376 = ~Poor creature? Poor creature?! Words of sympathy I not need! This place is an eternal tomb for the victims of battle long forgotten, and you offer pity?! Even untwisted I would laugh, but now I even hate! You who walk here just as I did; you will fall as I did from an enemy just as unthinkable! The difference is that Durlag will not be there to take the credit of victory! We fought the demon also! We fought also! Legend speaks of him, not of undead also-foughts!~
@23378 = ~The long, curved, single edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerun. Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder, providing more accurate, damaging attacks, a faster attack speed factor, and the ability to strike opponents that are immune to normal weapons.

@23379 = ~Um, yes. An interesting tale, but I should be going now.~
@23385 = ~An unthinkable enemy? Of what do you speak?~
@23386 = ~An evil so grand only fools chase and fight. A Tanar'ri true and horrible. Its name you do not speak unless its attention you wish to bring. Long before it walked and stalked, long before even the fall of the tower. We fought along with Durlag to encase the evil away. His was the blow that won, and ours were the souls that lost. Here we stay, turned to evil and unredeemable, but heroes still and not to be killed! A cruel charity! Durlag is legend and we are a pity! Beware the gaze that is not a gaze, but a look into your soul!~
@23391 = ~You run because you are fearful of what we are... what I am? You will see much worse here, and places yet unknown. If you cannot stomach what I have become, then you will surely fall to others. I will do a service for you! I will show you suffering here! You may survive elsewhere if you survive here, and if you die you will have been spared the waiting and worrying. This I do for you!~
@23392 = ~I will not be dismissed! We go unknown for so long, joined only by death and more death! You will not walk away ignoring! You will remember and take my name from this place! You will remember the pain I give you!~
@23393 = ~Is there anything? You can do nothing! You can do nothing except... you can take my name from this place. You can take the memory of battle and my name and I will be free from the shadow of Durlag and that damnable demon. Fight now, that you can say true that we battle ferocious! You will take the memory from here!~
@23394 = ~Naive righteous fury! That is what I was armed with as well! Here is where it led, and here is where you will be too if you do not judge your targets carefully, as well as harshly. I speak from the dead with experience. You who were like me... you who are as I was... your existence mocks mine! You wish to cleanse this place? You are welcome to try!~
@23398 = ~I have met the village historian, a woman by the name of Delainy. She seemed rather nice, actually. I have agreed to help her with a small problem she was having. It seems that an important symbol for her village, a cloak, blew away from the chieftain's hut in the recent storm. It is probably outside the walls, so I shall have to watch out for the "beasts" that the locals keep mentioning. I shall have to ask Delainy to tell me more about her people when I get back. I'm sure she won't mind.~
@23399 = ~I have met the village historian, a man by the name of Durlyle. He seemed rather nice, actually. I have agreed to help him with a small problem he was having.

It is probably outside the walls, so I shall have to watch out for the "beasts" that the locals keep mentioning. Hopefully this will not take too much time.~

@23403 = ~I returned the village cloak to that Durlyle person. He was grateful enough, though I think he doesn't like me all that much.~
@23404 = ~The villagers came to this place long ago, after being marooned. They were from the far west, and someone called "the explorers" brought them. There was a great storm that their elders said "could have come from within," or some such. Their people were to be cast out; they were probably thought of as ballast, and they fought. They survived and made a home here.~
@23408 = ~This machinery seem somehow connected to the burial chamber to the north. There is a lever to pull, but it can only be operated with a key of some sorts.~
@23410 = ~The mystery of this island has become clear. Mendas/Selaad sent us to the island on the false pretenses of retrieving evidence from what was believed to be Balduran's shipwreck. It was indeed the adventurer's ship, though his personal fate yet remains a mystery. Balduran's crew were infected with lycanthropy sometime during that fateful voyage. The ship was beached and wrecked leaving the two strains of lycanthropes, werwolves and wolfweres to fight amongst themselves for survival. The more organized werewolves built the village that we recently shipwrecked near on our own fateful voyage. The chaotic wolfweres took residence in the ruins of Balduran's ship and both packs survived in uneasy co-existence since then. Mendas/Selaad eventually took the risk of sailing for the mainland. Somehow he made it and, upon discovering that someone had finally found the island, made up a plausible tale and had us first steal the sea charts, and later travel to the island to put them in his werewolf mate's hands. She had us kill the wolfweres and then infected the party with lycanthropy, intending us to join the pack or die fighting. We killed her, took the charts and sailed home to finally discover the truth of Mendas' duplicity. Fate seems to enjoy toying with me.~
@23411 = ~They haven't indicated exactly what they mean when they say "they belong." Outsiders do not belong, and they do. Probably some sort of ritual to become a citizen.~
@23412 = ~I seem to have made Delainy mad at me, though I think she is just touchy and unused to my kind of person. She said I was more animal than civilized, and that their pack was strong without me. As if I would want to stay here with them anyway. Delainy had a nice manner though. Ah well, plenty of fish in the sea.~
@23413 = ~Hirelings return. Master Selaad awaits you.~
@23416 = ~Out of my way, fool! I haven't the patience this evening.~
@23417 = ~The master has many names on this accursed soil. Selaad is the only true one. It is not your concern.~
@23420 = ~Selaad Gan is the chief of the true people. He awaits the return of his mate Kaishas. Why have you not returned with her?~
@23421 = ~It is not your place to question me. What part do you play in this?~
@23433 = ~Murderous wretch! Filth! The master will eat thy marrow for this.~
@23437 = ~Your task was clear: travel to the island-home and retrieve master's kin. Failing that, Kaishas was to take the sea charts from you. Useless manlings! Selaad does not brook failure well.~
@23438 = ~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Kaishas attacked us and we were forced to defend ourselves. Mendas was betrayed by his own cleverness.~
@23439 = ~Mendas deceived us. He is the one that we must confront. You are merely a flunky.~
@23442 = ~I rather enjoyed talking to Delainy. She seemed... to like me. I call her friend with no hesitation.~
@23443 = ~I rather enjoyed talking to Durlyle. He seemed... to like me. I call him friend with no hesitation.~
@23446 = ~I have agreed to fetch some flowers for Delainy. 'Tis hardly what I would call work. I might have brought them to her anyway. I think I am growing rather fond of the woman. She's not put off by me being an "outsider." The flowers she wishes grow outside the wall, so I will search there for them.~
@23447 = ~I have agreed to fetch some flowers for Durlyle. 'Tis hardly what I would call work. I might have brought them to him anyway. I think I am growing rather fond of the man. He's not put off by me being an "outsider." The flowers he wishes grow outside the wall, so I will search there for them.~
@23450 = ~You have come quite far... not many live to speak... less live to leave... you are far from done... I hold surprises yet... seek direction in this place... when you understand the path... when you understand the course... you will be able to go on... you must be worthy to face what comes... there is evil here not built within... you must expel the new invaders...~
@23453 = ~Do you mean me harm? I will not yield to ghosts and spectres!~
@23454 = ~Am I... Durlag? You have cause to wonder... you have seen traps and illusions and phantoms... but the spirit of Durlag has long since passed... to whatever fate the dark veil holds... this place... this place is his fear... his anger... his torment. You wish to conquer this place?  You will have to understand what created it... remember well what you have already seen... or leave now and live life long and natural... three paths lead away... all must be taken...~
@23455 = ~I am a shadow of a man... I am Durlag... more or less... the spirit of the builder has long since passed... gone to whatever reward the black veil holds... this place sustains the fear... the anger... frustration... You have seen phantoms and illusions... remember what you have learned... you may yet conquer... but you must understand the paths... three paths lead away... all must be taken... seek direction...~
@23456 = ~You will yield to this place... if you do not understand... you have seen phantoms and illusions... shadows of those long since passed beyond the black veil of death to whatever reward... This place... harbors the anger... the fear... you will have to understand what built it... to pass by unharmed... seek direction... understand the paths... three paths lead away... all must be taken...~
@23457 = ~Seek direction... understand the path... and the way will yield... three paths lead away... all are necessary... understand them to return...~
@23458 = ~I have encountered a phantom, perhaps of Durlag himself. It said that the true spirit of Durlag passed long ago, but his hatred and fear that built the tower still maintain it. It said I must understand two of the "paths" that led to this place. After that, "the way" will become clear. It seems to want something as well. It said there was a new evil here, something not a part of the tower that must be expelled. I don't fancy being this creature's lackey, but I may have no choice... unless I just leave.~
@23459 = ~I must seek direction and understand the three paths in order to "return" and progress.~
@23460 = ~You have found the room that gives direction, but are not done yet... The way is not yet clear... understand the paths that lead away... and you will return...~
@23462 = ~You will survive this place... you understand what built the hate... the fear... now you must prevent it becoming worse... a creature below... powerful beyond all... you must remove... or it shall make this place its own... such a fortress... impenetrable if remade in his image...~
@23464 = ~If there is evil to be fought, I will defeat it.~
@23466 = ~Profit... not immediate... but profit is relative... how much profit do you lose if an new power takes this place... subjugates and kills... you must have economy to exploit, or what is profit... You do as you will... the way is clear... follow me...~
@23467 = ~There is always evil to be fought... within and without... do as you will... the way is clear... follow me...~
@23468 = ~The fight becomes the concern of all... a new power threatens... upsets balance and measure... the way is clear... do as you wish... follow me...~
@23469 = ~You have found the room that gives direction, but are not done yet... The way is not yet clear... understand the paths that lead away... and you will return...~
@23470 = ~You have found the room that gives direction, but are not done yet... The way is not yet clear... understand the paths that lead away... and you will return...~
@23474 = ~The Recipes and Ruminations of One Dradeel of Tethir

Formerly

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim.
************
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour,
The eggs of a seabird,
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening,
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising.
Bake in a well-stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor.
************
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not recommended as the primary meal every day for three hundred years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherese Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.
************
Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy.
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely known vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him.

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolven clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.
************
The Bachelor's Crutch
Noodles of quality and convenience.

Ingredients:
A measure of noodles.
Boiling water
Container

Combine ingredients in container.
Enjoy. Oh yes, enjoy.

Notes to myself: Should probably be supplemented with something of nutritional value, lest my bones become brittle as chalk. Perhaps the container?

@23495 = ~This machine seems to be the power source for something in the room to the north.  A small inscription above a small key slot reads: "Insert Bone Wardstone here in order to disable rune traps."~
@23496 = ~A small inscription above a small key slot reads: "Insert Bone Wardstone here in order to disable rune traps."

When you insert the bone wardstone into the machine's key slot, you feel the machine hum for a few moments and then quiet down. You are sure that something has been turned off.~
@23498 = ~Odd... Someone I had never met approached me after I returned from the tower. They demanded the dagger I took from Durlag's death chamber. I gave him the item as requested though he seemed none too grateful. What he wanted with such a trinket, I do not know.~
@23508 = ~I have found and rescued her son as Therella wished. His fellows are dead, but he will live.~
@23509 = ~I have rescued a young man from the very clutches of this place. He will live, but not without some lasting effects, I am sure. He had to kill his own double, and came very close to death himself. He is young... he will survive.~

@23524 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's bane
I live in the darkness of his soul
I bring him to his knees,
Trembling and weeping
Unable to lift a hand in his own defense
Yet I sleep... Awaken me.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What will awaken this warder? Perhaps a loud noise like a drum or a gong. Perhaps something else. I must solve this riddle to pass.~
@23532 = ~I met a huckster by the name of Ike who was offering tours of Durlag's Tower. Seems the venerable deathtrap has become a bit of a tourist attraction. I agreed to the tour, so I should meet Ike by the tower as soon as possible. I'm sure it will be safe. They wouldn't walk people through if there was still a danger.~
@23534 = ~The stories of Durlag's opulence spread across the land, and the most unsavory of creatures sought to make the tower theirs. All of Durlag's kin and friends were replaced by doppelgangers, and he found himself killing the visages of those that he cared most, just to save himself. In the end he drove the invaders from his home, and vowed that none would dare the same again!~
@23536 = ~Those that passed the wards were confronted with the fruits of the paranoia that consumed Durlag. He had traps crafted for every inch of floor and wall, and nary a step could be taken without triggering a horrendous effect.~
@23537 = ~I have agreed to try and use Ike's ward token and explore some of the lower rooms of Durlag's Tower. He seems to think that I am up to the challenge, and I agree...~
@23540 = ~I have seen a strange apparition. It looked to be one of Durlag's own kin at the very moment they discovered the doppelganger incursion. This "Kiel" accused a doppelganger of wearing his face and helm. Such powerful emotions to replay the event even to this day.~
@23544 = ~I met a woman in the forest that claimed a young man named Jondal had been killed by wolf-men. It was not my problem.~
@23549 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's madness
I curse him with trust and respect
I slow the blade in its course
By stealing his passion for blood
And offering a softer emotion in return
Yet I thirst for more... Give me the sweet crimson drink of laughter and passion.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What does this warder thirst for? What drink is commonly associated with passion and where on this level would it make sense to find or make such a drink? I must solve this riddle to pass.~
@23552 = ~Maralee has told me of a secret way to get off the island. In the chieftain's hut there is a hidden door that leads to "their homes below the ground." There is apparently an exit that leads to a ship they have built.~
@23554 = ~Save game failed. Do you wish to quit?~
@23561 = ~Villainy is afoot! I have agreed to help a young man rout some "monsters" before they can do any harm. He leads the way as I write!~
@23564 = ~I know you... oh yes, don't think I don't... You, who dare to show your face here!~
@23566 = ~You have me at a disadvantage, sir. You claim to know me, but I am not acquainted with you.~
@23568 = ~And you would be... who, exactly? I can't say I've had the pleasure.~
@23569 = ~Spare me your false pretensions and manners, I see through them as I see through light and day! And save your disgusting innocence and ignorance! You know me well and true, though we have not met in person to personal manner. My name, most foul whelp, is Shandalar! Yes, I see the dim lights of recognition in your eyes. Like a bolt from the sky, though I get ahead of myself. You did slaughter that which I held most dear! For Shaaaaame!~
@23570 = ~Shandalar... Shandalar... no, it doesn't ring any bells for me. Perhaps if you told me what it is I'm supposed to have done?~
@23573 = ~I expected such bravado from you... such is the mind of they that would prove their mettle by slaughtering three simple children! You have participated in the murder of the daughters of Shandalar and, surprisingly enough, I consider that a verrrrry naughty act. What have you to say for yourself in defense? State why I should not make interesting little noisemakers from your vertebrae and sell them to bugbear children!~
@23574 = ~You will not insult me so! That you cannot remember the incident is doubly infuriating! To have snuffed out the lights of my life and not even recall the deed is the height of indignity! Shandalar accuses, and you WILL admit!~
@23576 = ~Shandalar...? Oh dear... Shandalar of Ulgoth's Beard? Shandalar that makes his home in a Halruaan skyship? Shandalar that charged his daughters to guard the components of such a skyship pending their sale? I've... uh... never heard of you... or your daughters.~
@23577 = ~Shandalar? I know of you. You were to sell the components of a skyship and I prevented it. Granted I did so at the cost of your daughters' lives, but you were the one that charged them with the task of guarding the items I sought. Why put them in harm's way if you were not prepared to lose them?~
@23579 = ~Your daughters were more than mere "simple children." They were in Oberon's Estate because you thought them able to defend themselves. If you did not wish to risk losing them, you should have guarded the Halruuan skyship components yourself.~
@23582 = ~Your pitiful attempts and lies are as transparent to me as the nature of existence... no wait, that's still fairly opaque... but YOU, you I see clearly for I see true! Do you really believe that one versed in magic such as I could not identify those responsible for the deaths of his children? You have a long road of repentance ahead of you, and no one is offering a ride! I send you! I send you on a pitiable errand! The means of your return will be found if you look, but do not expect the way to be easy! If you do well, I may yet decide not to invert your faces! Away, away, AWAY! And bring me back a lovely souvenir! A cloak perhaps!~
@23583 = ~Your argument falls short of becoming a reason not to kill you! I suppose it is my fault and not the thief's if I am burgled in my home? After all, it is not his fault that I amassed wealth and dared to "display" it in mine home. In a mob rule you might have a chance, but I am but a mob of one! Shandalar spits at you and condemns with the same breath! You will perform a duty to me as part of penance, and if you succeed you will be a measure closer to repayment! I send you! I send you and you may not return without a lovely souvenir! A cloak perhaps!~
@23584 = ~There, you see? Was that so hard to admit? I'm sure you will agree it is better to maintain a level of honesty in all of one's dealings. Now that that is out of the way, I have a task that you WILL perform. Oh, you are still to be punished, but you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you purged your conscience ahead of time. Much more rehabilitating. You are to do me a service. I will send you where you must go, and you must return with the item I need. A simple cloak is your target, but do NOT wear it! You have already abused too much of what is mine. Go now!~
@23585 = ~Halt! You who are not worthy to walk here, will stand and listen! I am Shandalar, and this town is in my protection. Such as you must prove your intent well and true, and show that you are to be allowed the same rights to life as those more responsible.~
@23587 = ~I ain't going to hurt nobody. Why don't you go bother some candy-snatchers and leave me to my own business?~
@23590 = ~So you say, but your actions have branded you less than desirable. Do you even have the will to try and restrain your ways while here, or are you a lost cause and just content with it? I shall determine, and judge as I see fit, for none else here have the power to do so. You will perform a task for me. I will send you where you must go, and you will return with the item I need. A simple cloak is your target, but do NOT wear it! It is mine and you will know the punishment before you get a second chance.~
@23592 = ~This cloak was originally stolen from Shandalar by the powerful mage Semia, presumably for the powerful magics woven into the fabric. How it has come to be in your possession and the fate of Semia are complete mysteries, and ones not likely to be solved, much like the exact workings of the cloak, which would remain a mystery even to a powerful mage.

@23595 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offense.~
@23596 = ~Because your business is unsavory and I don't like it. Your actions have branded you, and I must determine if such a brand is accurate and deserved. Cows are branded, but theirs is not the will behind it. Likewise, perhaps you are of good intent but are just inept. Thus is my quandry.~
@23597 = ~You will do a task for me, and prove your worth. Success means I may not kill you outright. Failure means I will not have to deal with you again anyway. I seek a simple cloak of mine. You will retrieve it and then you may return. Do not wear it, as it is mine and you will not survive.~
@23600 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offense.~
@23604 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offense.~
@23606 = ~Because I am busy. Because I have better things to do. Because it is menial, dangerous, tiresome, a chore... you choose whichever reason makes you happy and full of cheer. You will do this regardless, and you will do so now. Here is a ward token that will return you once the chore is done and you have the item. Do be quick about it!~
@23607 = ~Who are you to speak of offense? Your very aura offends. You will do this, and you will do it now. Here is the ward token that will return you once the task is done. Be grateful I remembered to give it to you.~
@23610 = ~I know of you. You are of an odd countenance, and I can count pretty darn high, too. I have need of you... What say you to this?~
@23614 = ~I am Shandalar, and I am the default benefactor of this place. My home is here, as are my major interests. I take interest in whoever comes this way, and you are very interesting indeed. I should like you to perform a task for me. A small thing, really, but something I do not have time for myself. I need for you to go to... another place... and retrieve an item of mine. Very simple, and if you succeed I will think all the better of you. What say you to this?~
@23620 = ~Such rudeness to your extremely powerful elders will only serve to get you roasted on a lightning spit while diseased gibberlings suckle your toes... but I digress, just a touch. I would ask a task of you, and now I think it all the more appropriate that you accept. I will judge the measure of you, and see what your respectable veneer has paneled over. You will retrieve a cloak for me, one that was left in a rather unfortunate place. When you have found it you will be returned. I think you will agree this is a menial chore.~
@23625 = ~Sensible. You may truly be as you appear, but I still must test to assure your nature. I would ask a task of you, that you retrieve an item I lost some time ago. You will be sent from this place to another place, and when you have succeeded, you will be allowed to return. Simple enough in my mind, though most things are, these days. The item is a cloak I have... misplaced. Your retrieving it will ease the burden of a busy evening. What say you?~
@23634 = ~Newcomers, stop where you are! I have questions to pose to you, and you will answer them swiftly and accurately, or you will be killed. I will warn you now that I possess powerful magics, and will be able to discern almost any lie that you try to tell.~
@23642 = ~We are the party of <CHARNAME>, and have come to find Shandalar's stolen cloak.~
@23645 = ~I have other things that call my attentions, so it is more convenient that you go. Besides, I know you not and this serves as a good measure of you. Already I know you are more interested in the "why" and not so much the profit. Will you do this?~
@23648 = ~We're trapped here, just like you. We angered a mage of great power and he transported us here as punishment.~
@23651 = ~I am Garan, and have been trapped on this infernal island ever since I tried to teleport from Maztica to Waterdeep. But it is not you who should be asking the questions. You have not answered mine yet. Speak now or suffer the consequences.~
@23652 = ~We are the party of <CHARNAME>, and have come to find Shandalar's stolen cloak.~
@23654 = ~We're trapped here, just like you. We angered a mage of great power and he transported us here as punishment.~
@23658 = ~You have come to take Shandalar's cloak, eh? Well, he must have given you something to get off of the island, something that I intend to have. Prepare to die, fools!~
@23659 = ~Now you see, I knew this was a good idea. Already I have a clearer picture of your worth, and I have not even sent you on the task yet. The profit will be directly related to your performance. In essence, anything you scrounge above and beyond my needs is yours. Sufficient?~
@23660 = ~Your joke will be the last that you ever make; now you DIE!~
@23661 = ~Bah! You're of no use to me... except perhaps as food for my animals. Come, my pets! Let us feast on these pathetic adventurers!~
@23663 = ~I told you that I ask the questions! Your stupidity will cost you dearly!~
@23665 = ~Most certainly. There will be your life and all that you scrounge. Anything beyond what I asked for is yours. Sufficient?~
@23669 = ~You are on your way, then. When you have located my cloak return to where you arrived and this ward token will effect your release... er... your passage back. Off you go now.~
@23673 = ~You return! Excellent! And you are little the worse for wear, in a relative sense. An excellent measure of your worth, I think. You have proven yourself quite capable. I will just relieve you of that item and be on my way.~
@23674 = ~Hehahee-he-heeee... been here long?~
@23684 = ~You return. You are proven capable, at least in this respect. Certainly you have the will to change your personal ways as well. We are square and fair, for the moment. I cannot guarantee that we will remain so, however, as your kind is to be scrutinized closely. Rather a non-existent short-term memory as well, I'm afraid. You have done me a favor, now do yourself one. Behave yourself until you are of positive standing in the community. Begone.~
@23685 = ~You return. I cannot say I am totally pleased with that, but you have done me a service, nonetheless. You may live, but we are still not square and fair. Cross my path again and the deaths of my daughters will be the fuel that drives my anger! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. For now, I am satisfied, but only for now. Begone.~
@23686 = ~No, no, none of us do, none of us do... Did you think I wanted this place?! Did you think I wanted to languish here for years, Tellan Altru'ar, once the shining light of Tethyr?! No, no, hehahee-he-heeee, not I, not I. Now give me that wardstone, buttercup, or I shall pluck your petals and watch ye rot!~
@23687 = ~Well, well, well. I sensed the ripples and there you are but... you are something new. Tell me, friend, how come you to this place?~
@23691 = ~Hmmm... You may call me Tellan Altru'ar, the shining light of Tethyr, for once I was, once I was. And you I shall call "buttercup" because I can and shall, hoo-hooo! You... have a way out of here, don't you? I smell it on you!~
@23695 = ~Relax, fellow; we have no reason to harm you.~
@23696 = ~Yes, I have a way out of here but no, you won't have it by threat or tears! If you must have it, then you can have it from my corpse, old fool!~
@23702 = ~That troll! Even in this accursed place she sends assassins. If Cuchol must die, then he shall not die alone.~
@23704 = ~Oh really, Cuchol... "beasts?" We prefer "hired goons."~
@23705 = ~Relax, fellow; we have no reason to harm you.~
@23706 = ~I do, but it comes with a price. There is a cloak I need to find and many here who would see me and my master dead before they let it fall from their grubby hands. Follow me and be of some assistance in the battles and mayhaps I'll let you come with me when I go.~
@23709 = ~A ward! Of course! My friends, I have been trapped here for too long. Think of my reputation! "Cuchol," they'll say, "What kind of mystical magic man are you?" Then I'll say "It's not my fault! It's that stupid ice!" Then they'll say "You're a loser Cuchol. A real fool, if you catch my drift." Can't you see? My reputation! I must have that ward! I must escape!~
@23712 = ~Shandalar! Well, that is a name I have not heard in awhile. Aye, he was here. The bastard managed to escape, though I know not how. This isle is much like a prison, and is uncharted on any map I have seen. The stars indicate we are far to the south, but I cannot seem to get more precise than this.~
@23715 = ~Hah, hah! Imagine her surprise when I show up in her bedchamber. "Oh, Cuchol, you've the body of a god!" she'll say. But enough of this! You are no longer useful.~
@23717 = ~You would? Really? No, you wouldn't, you wouldn't... but you could... Hehahee he heeee... No magic, though, I will save my magic in case you turn on me... But darts, yes, I'll cast my darts into their very eyes if it shall get me off this frigid rock!~
@23718 = ~I am Andris, and you will lower your voice or find yourself swimming. Hmmm... Perhaps you have come in the normal way after all. Most are not too happy about arriving here. No doubt you are confused, but I will explain. Here is the island. It has no other name than this, and is too small to appear on any map. By the stars I would place us deep in the Trackless Sea, perhaps even further afield than far-southern Chult, though I cannot really say.~
@23720 = ~Well, I have nothing to do and a vast intellect that starves for some enjoyment! On your hands and knees, child!~
@23721 = ~You are just the latest teleporting fool to be captured. This place seems a magnet of sorts. If you are powerful enough to transport without error across an ocean, you are apparently of sufficient power to be caught and dragged here. It is the very place that does it... seems to ensnare the energy. Needless to say, leaving the island by magical means seems entirely impossible. You will get used to seabird eggs if you wish to survive.~
@23724 = ~I am Andris, and that is some strange kind of friend you have. This isle is as uncharted as they get and may as well be a prison. The stars say we are deep in the Trackless Sea, perhaps even more south than Chult, if that is possible.~
@23725 = ~This place seems to ensnare magical energy, pulling it from the air. If you are a mage in transport, it pulls you as well. Plucks you from the ether and deposits you here. Leaving the island by magical means seems entirely impossible.~
@23729 = ~I don't know an answer to either question. It could be a joke of the gods, or a test... or both. It is hard to tell with gods. It could be a natural phenomenon, though the tunnels below certainly are not. Trapped mages may have fashioned them for shelter however. There is little else to do here except plot, study, or go mad. I prefer to plot. On that note, if you would be so kind as to strip down and give me what you are carrying I would be ever so grateful.~
@23730 = ~Oh, certainly it must. Whether this place is a joke, test or simply phenomenon, it is just a matter of finding the proper method of exit. I favor the pure power theory, wherein you merely need an excess of magical resources to overpower the pull. I am gathering all the power I can, to wit I must ask that you strip down. Nothing personal, but I really need whatever you are carrying.~
@23731 = ~What do I want? What do I want?! To be free of this place! It does not matter whether this place is a joke, test or phenomenon, I need more power to escape! If you would kindly strip of your belongings I would be ever so grateful.~
@23735 = ~You seem quite at home here... deceptively so. What is it you want from me?~
@23736 = ~PERHAPS it is of value? PERHAPS?! You are a fool to tempt me if you lie, and a fool to have mentioned it at all! I will not barter, and I will not bargain! I will take everything on your corpse and find the means myself! Be this place a test, joke or phenomenon, I will be free of it!~
@23737 = ~You have the means to leave? You are a fool to tempt me if you are lying, and even more a fool if you tell the truth! I care not a whit for your task, nor for your lives! If you possess the means to leave I must have it, and have it now! I shall take it from you! You should not wave food in front of those who starve!~
@23749 = ~If you want my equipment, you are going to have to take it!~
@23750 = ~Wait... I have a means to leave! Perhaps we can work out a deal.~
@23753 = ~But why? I think I can overpower the pull of this place if I have enough magical energy. You may have items, or your very being may yield fuel. I care not which, and I am through talking!~
@23755 = ~If you want my equipment, you are going to have to take it!~
@23756 = ~Wait... I have a means to leave! Perhaps we can work out a deal.~
@23758 = ~If you want my equipment, you are going to have to take it!~
@23759 = ~Wait... I have a means to leave! Perhaps we can work out a deal.~
@23760 = ~Now now now... hello there! And who might you be? Another wayward spellslinger looking for a way out? Or just another power-hungry fool trying to force the doors from the wrong side? Tell me, warrior, why is it that whatever you seek is always in the last place you look?~
@23761 = ~Um... because you find it?~
@23762 = ~I have no time for your riddles! I seek a cloak that belongs to Shandalar!~
@23765 = ~Do you now? And he did not come for it himself? Of course not. He left this place only by shedding his most powerful dweomers. More sensible to send you, who are of lesser power. No doubt he will extricate you using some sort of focus, drawing you away with magic centered elsewhere once you have completed your task. Have I guessed your means of travel? Do you even know?~
@23766 = ~The others here are like me, in that they do not understand this place. I doubt the place itself could tell its own purpose were it able to answer questions. Suffice it that I am not so quick to turn to desperation as the others, and I do not fear the unknown quite so much. If this place draws magical energies to it, and I am here at the center, then it draws magical energy to me by default. In time I will harness it, and in time I will leave. Already I know more of things here than any other. I can see things... things others cannot.~
@23767 = ~How do you know these things of me?~
@23771 = ~I ignore nothing here, and I see far more than you. I have been here long and have used my time effectively. Some fall or go mad, but I have learned. Do I understand this place? No, but I begin to. It stores what it brings for something long since forgotten. Perhaps when I remember it I will master it... perhaps not. You are but an interloper, a messenger, and the power of someone else will remove you from afar. Do what you must, I can only gain in this. I win, I am released. I lose, I am released.~
@23773 = ~How do you know these things of me?~
@23778 = ~I see why you are here. I see that I have what you seek. I see that we must fight and the victor shall leave. What is this place? Many things. Today it is a dueling pit. Tomorrow it will be a graveyard. Yesterday it was... what? I cannot say. If it is natural, it is an abomination. If it is divine, it is utterly cruel. We are all many things, including obtuse and unclear. Do what you will. If I win, I am released. If I lose, I am released.~
@23781 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's curse
I steal his future
I mar his past
The more he has, the less it seems
He becomes a slave
Of glittering things
Yet I hunger... Feed me that which glitters beyond all else.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What glittering thing could this warder wish of me? Gold? A gem? I must solve this riddle to pass.~
@23784 = ~Why must we fight? Cannot let you live knowing all this. We could have existed peacefully, but now you have fought and will never accept. Others will come to kill or capture. Adventurers like you always come, do they not? No, I must fight, and you must die! We may still have hope if Selaad returns, but you cannot help anymore.~
@23796 = ~This is a false door. Behind it is solid rock.~
@23799 = ~The use of magic causes a collection of magical residue around the caster. It is this residue which prevents even the most skilled of casters from casting spells in quick succession.
Daer'Ragh's Aura Cleaning removes the residue of spell casting as the next spell casting begins. This allows a greatly increased rate of spell casting.~

@23960 = ~Rhashad's Talon~
@23961 = ~Scimitar +2: "Rhashad's Talon"

This blade has traveled far since its forging on the shores of the Shining Sea, though documentation of its passage is sketchy because of the mundane nature of the item. Such weapons are considered commonplace among the rich elite of the far south, and are of little consequence to historians of the area. This attitude is incomprehensible to a citizen of the Sword Coast, where people routinely die for items of equal or lesser enchantment. This particular blade may have belonged to a wealthy Vizir, or perhaps his attendant.

None know better than halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.

This is a legendary weapon of heroic proportions, especially among the far-northern tribes of barbarians. Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

@23967 = ~Mace +2: "Krotan's Skullcrusher"

Even the hordes have their heroes, and while they are vilified in civilized company, their deeds are sometimes impressive nonetheless.  Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

@23970 = ~Flame Tongue (Long Sword): "The Burning Earth"

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself, but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

@23975 = ~Plate Mail +3: "The Practical Defense"

The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur "Thunderaxe" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight, though this suit is just over one-third the weight of normal plate mail: his ideal suit should also be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of Full Plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.

This finely crafted stave was among the spoils taken from the invaders of Durlag's Tower. It is very deadly in combat, and was apparently the property of a spellcaster that enjoyed standing on the frontlines. It appears to have a core of iron, yet it is comparable in weight to a normal weapon of its type. Part of the enchantment seems to come from the hide that strengthens the grip; leather no doubt made from a battle-ready creature of some sort. With the tastes and inclinations of the attackers of the Tower well documented, the hide could be almost anything... or anyone.

@23985 = ~Greagan's Harp: "The Captive Audience"

This finely made harp is well known among the nomadic peoples of the east, though more for the infamy of its owner, Greagan of the Low Hills. He was a bard, of sorts, though less for his love of people than his hatred of hard work.  He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using "his" music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances. The magic seems to be waning as well, and perhaps this is one item best lost to time.

STATISTICS:

Special: Dominates a single victim each time it is played, as per the 5th level wizard spell Domination (victim must save vs. spells at -2 to avoid the effect). Has a finite number of charges left.

@23997 = ~The Journal of Andris of Iriaebor

Would that I had more paper to write upon, but much was burned in haste for warmth. Little there is to document anyway, and so I leave this small writ for any that might find my corpse, for that is the only way it shall part from me. Know that Andris does curse you for your life, and that should I return in some fell form I will hunt you for the sheer spite of you seeing my decimated body. The business of that aside, I hope that you who read this have suffered the same fate as I. The indignity of this condition! With all the power at mine fingers I must huddle around a dung-fire eating seal fat! The forces behind this place have no respect for my stature, my power! I have slain beasts thrice my size with a glance, and traveled as a bird over oceans! Here my magic is sucked to the earth and I am held, as others are. Some have escaped, and I swear I shall hunt them and take the power they must have. To do what I cannot they must be great indeed. I curse them for leaving, I curse this place, and I curse that I have not the might to follow.

@23998 = ~Scribble scribble scribble, as every mage must do.
These walls will hold your power fast, unless I walk right through.
A boat I bade from birch and bark, but burned I did at morn.
Rather I gather in this held spot, than suffer my hands get worn.

Fools this place has, and many more to come. I will greet and take what will, and in the end will I have all? Oh, I think so. I mock your prison, AO, as though you would care to listen. Are you even behind the walls? I see your symbols in the sky, but others too. Mystra, goddess of magic, my magical maiden, why do you treat your children so? Do you give the sparkle of magic only so it cannot be used? A lesson in humility for those on the verge of true power? Drop your robes and wands and staves, or forever be trapped with your self-importance and pride? Perhaps, but I will not shed what I have earned just to walk the skies again. I shall profit from this; I will play outside your rules. This place will bring it all to me in time, though I can't take it elsewhere. No, you can't take it with you, but you can stay with it, and hold it tight. Perhaps with outside help? Bah! None but those who have learned can find this place again, and they will not interrupt the teaching. I will not bend; I will snap and strike back in time. Humility is so... humiliating, and I will not suffer more. Power impotent is still preferable to power lost.

Of course, perhaps the walls do not listen to such musings, and my writing is pointless. No matter, for tomorrow I shall wipe this clean and write anew. My verse gets better. One must have hobbies.~

To immediately start the mission pack load your final save. Doing so will transport your party to Ulgoth's Beard. If you do not have a final save you may use the save game "Mission Pack Save" to start the mission pack.
Note: You do not have to choose this method to enjoy the new areas; if you wish, you may load any save game and walk to the town of Ulgoth's Beard, where all of the new adventures begin.

In the context of the overall Baldur's Gate campaign, the events you are about to embark upon take place before the final confrontation with Sarevok, and use the saved game that was created just before you entered his hidden lair. Once you have completed the mission pack you may wish to return to the depths beneath the great city of Baldur's Gate to finish off your murderous half-brother once more, stronger and better equipped than you could have been before.

The traps and "tests" left by Durlag are beyond his ability, or so he seemed to think. Some are extremely lethal, offering no second chance to a trespasser. This place is not meant to hinder, but to kill. He is also afraid of the creature that has taken up residence here. It is apparently a "demonknight," some type of fell servant from the lower planes that is supposedly extremely powerful. Bayard feels that attacking such a creature directly is tantamount to suicide. Perhaps his fear will serve him well, but I must go onward. I shall keep an eye out for these "wardstones" that he mentioned as well. They must be keys of a sort.~
